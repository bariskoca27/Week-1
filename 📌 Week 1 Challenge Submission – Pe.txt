📌 Week 1 Challenge Submission – Personal Portfolio Webpage

✅ What I Have Done:

1. 🧭 Built a Sticky Navigation Bar
I created a responsive and sticky navigation bar that stays fixed at the top as users scroll. It links to the About, Projects, and Contact sections of the page.
🔧 CSS tools used: display: flex, justify-content, gap, and position: sticky.

2. 👤 Developed an About Section
I added an "About Me" section that includes a profile image and short bio text. This section uses Flexbox for layout to align the image and text horizontally (or vertically on smaller screens).
🔧 CSS tools used: display: flex, gap, border-radius, and responsive media queries.

3. 🗂️ Created a Projects Section
I showcased three project cards, each with an image and descriptive text. I designed them in a grid layout and added hover effects for better user interaction.
🔧 CSS tools used: flex-wrap, box-shadow, hover:transform, and transition.

4. 📬 Designed a Contact Form
I added a contact form with input fields for name, email, and a message. I also included clickable email and phone links using mailto: and tel:.
🔧 CSS tools used: flex-direction: column, input styling, and :hover effects for the button.

5. 📱 Ensured Full Responsiveness
I used media queries to make the entire site mobile- and tablet-friendly. Content reflows properly, and navigation remains usable on all screen sizes.
🔧 CSS tools used: @media queries, flexible widths, and adaptive layout with Flexbox.

6. 🎨 Applied Consistent Styling with CSS
I used an external CSS file to control the site's layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. I used Google Fonts (Montserrat), consistent font sizes, hover color transitions, and a professional color palette.
🔧 CSS tools used: font-family, color, padding, margin, border, box-shadow, hover effects, and selectors (class, ID, and element).

7. 🧾 Footer Section
I created a footer that includes copyright information and illustration credits.
